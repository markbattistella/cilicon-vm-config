# Cilicon Resource files

These are the Resource files I've made based on the traderepublic/Cilicon 
repo.

Inside the `Editor Resources` folder are the following files:

`start.command`

The command script that will run at launchtime on the macOS login items.

`setup-actions.sh`

The bash script which when run will download the action-runner files from 
Gtihub, unzip them, and run the configuation.

`/data` folder

All the files for the data info you need to add from the Github 
self-hosted runner screen.
